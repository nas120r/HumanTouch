## Introduction

HumanTouch is designed for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to enhance AI text generation. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this tool bridges the gap between robotic text and human-like writing. 

## Features

- **DoRA Fine-Tuned Qwen Models**: Achieve high-quality text generation that closely mimics human writing styles.
- **Interactive Training Modes**: Experiment with various training configurations to optimize model performance.
- **Google Colab Support**: Run experiments directly in your browser without complex setup.
- **Comprehensive Data Processing Pipeline**: Process and humanize large datasets with ease.

## Installation

To get started with HumanTouch, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nas120r/HumanTouch.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd HumanTouch
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use the following command to install necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/nas120r/HumanTouch/releases) section to download the required model files. Follow the instructions provided there to set up your environment.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using HumanTouch by importing the library in your Python scripts. Here's a simple example:

```python
from human_touch import QwenModel

model = QwenModel()
output = model.generate("Your input text here.")
print(output)
```

## Interactive Training Modes

HumanTouch offers various training modes that allow you to customize how the model learns from data. You can choose between:

- **Supervised Learning**: Train the model on labeled datasets.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Allow the model to learn from unstructured data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimize the model based on feedback from generated outputs.

You can switch between modes easily by adjusting the configuration settings in your script.

## Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline is a critical component of HumanTouch. It allows you to preprocess your datasets effectively. The pipeline includes:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove unwanted characters and formatting.
2. **Tokenization**: Break down text into manageable tokens.
3. **Contextualization**: Enhance the text with additional context to improve humanization.

You can customize each step of the pipeline to fit your specific needs.

## Google Colab Support

HumanTouch is compatible with Google Colab, making it easy to run your models in the cloud. Simply open a new notebook and follow these steps:

1. **Import the Library**:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/nas120r/HumanTouch.git
   %cd HumanTouch
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Load Your Model**:
   ```python
   from human_touch import QwenModel
   model = QwenModel()
   ```

3. **Generate Text**:
   ```python
   output = model.generate("Your input text here.")
   print(output)
   ```

Using Google Colab allows you to leverage powerful hardware without needing to set up your local environment.
